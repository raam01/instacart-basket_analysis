# Instacart product recommendation system

This repository consists of building a recommendation system for items ordered through Instacart. The original data is obtained from Kaggle.

Mean Averge Precision is the metric used to evaluate model performance. Because the recommendations were not actully made in real life, it is just assumed to be made for the sake of model comparison. The models have to be tested in real world for checking actual performance.
